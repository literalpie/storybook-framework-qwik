# Contributing

PRs welcome, Contributions appreciated, blah blah blah.

I would especially appreciate contributions to issues marked "help wanted" or "high priority".

Comment on an issue if you would like any information or help! I'm happy to chat, or even do a short video call if it is helpful to pair on something. I'm also available in the Qwik and Storybook Discords, `@literalpie`.

## Building and Testing

`yarn watch` at the workspace level will build and watch the library.
`yarn dev` will watch the library, and also build/launch the qwik-app storybook.

After making changes, please run `yarn test` and `yarn lint-all` to make sure the build will pass.
